Przypominacz o Rachunkach (Bills reminder).
Simple Java 8 project wich manage your bills. One xml file is databese for one single year. It first checks for valid xml data files in application folder. If no found, new one is created. If one found, it will use it, if more user can choose it. Its based on list of Payment class objects, wich are equal when name and payment deadline are the same(to prevent double bills in same month). When new month comes, app will search for payments wich will take place in new month and store it in new month list. User can view,add,delete,pay bills, there are bills statistics.
